- Add @update:tableContext event to table to allow user to retrieve the table context easily. The Table context retrieves the following information about the table:
  - Total Items
  - Current Page
  - Items per page
  - Sort Field
  - Sort Direction
  - Filters


- Fix issue where cursor doesn't change to pointer when hovering over the pagination buttons.
