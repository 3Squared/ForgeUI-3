* Changed the size of the confirmation modal by removing the modal-sm class from the Dialog passthrough
* Updated the forge form field to add a wrapper class around the input, also containing the validation text
* Updated the styling classes on sadin forge form field, to remove the `flex-1` from the textarea, as this appears to stop it from being resized
* Updated the logic for displaying sort orders when using the row group header in the data table, as some of the properties are not set when the table is empty
