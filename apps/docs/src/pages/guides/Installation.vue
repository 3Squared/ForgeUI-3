  <ForgePageHeader title="Getting Started with Forge.UI 3" />
  
  This getting started guide will give a comprehensive guide of how to install ForgeUI into your app, please consult the
  component pages for detailed examples of how to use each component.

  <div class="my-5">
    <h4 class="mb-3">Step 1 - Installing Forge.UI 3</h4>

    As Forge.UI 3 is open source, the package is distributed via npm. In order to install Forge.UI 3 from npm, you will
    need to run the following command.

    <CodeBlock code="npm i @3squared/forge-ui-3" class="mt-3" />
  </div>

  <div class="my-5">
    <h4 class="mb-3">Step 2 - The PrimeVue Plugin</h4>

    Now that you have the package installed, the next step is to install the PrimeVue plugin using the custom Bootstrap 5
    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://primevue.org/passthrough/"><strong>passthrough object</strong></a>
    which is supplied by Forge.UI 3.
    
    <CodeBlock :code="step2Code" class="mt-3" />
  </div>

  <div class="my-5">
    <h4 class="mb-3">Step 3 - Importing the CSS</h4>

    Finally, we need to import the custom css. For those not using a pre-processor, you will simply need to import the css in your main.ts file like so.

    <CodeBlock :code="step3CodeBasicImport" class="mt-3" />
    
    If you are using a pre-processor, you have the option to import the css in your main sass file. By doing this, it also allows you to customise the theme colours to your liking!

    <CodeBlock :code="step3CodeSassImport" class="mt-3" />
  </div>
  <div class="my-5">
    <h4 class="mb-3">Step 4 - Run your project</h4>
    
    If you have followed the steps correctly, you should now be able to use the Forge.UI 3 and PrimeVue components in your codebase. Guides on how to use these components are documented across this site along with relevant links.
