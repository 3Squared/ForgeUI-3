  - `ForgeAlert`, `#messageicon` slot is now `#icon`
  - `FrogeNavbar`, `#menubuttonicon` slot is now `#buttonicon`

  - `DataView`
  - `ForgeAutoComplete`
  - `ForgeChip`
  - `Tags`
  - `Panel` - can be used as a single accordion
  - Add examples for `Button`, `Navbar`, `Table`, `DataView`, `AutoComplete` (not all these are documented)

  - Default for `ForgeTable` paging is now 5

### Minor Changes

- 221d4c4: Replace use of VueMultiselect with PrimeVue Multiselect.

  `ForgeMultiselect` is still usable but has been placed in a folder labelled deprecated to avoid future use.
  It has also been removed from the styleguide and replace with the newly styled PrimeVue multiselect.

  Migration Guide: Replace `ForgeMultiselect` with `Multiselect` see docs for how this can be implemented and use [PrimeVue](https://v3.primevue.org/multiselect/) docs.

  `ForgeMultiselectPreview` now uses the PrimeVue `Multiselect`. This may mean some props no longer work. Again see PrimeVue docs for further guidance.

  - 75: 75%,
  - 80: 80%,
  - 90: 90%,
  - 100: 100%,

  These can be used by appending the size needed to `w-` e.g. 20% would be `w-20`
